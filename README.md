## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Component

This 2FA component provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to securely verify their identity. It prompts the user to enter a **6-digit code** generated by their **authenticator app**.

Built with `SvelteKit` and `Tailwind`, using the `TypeScript` language for type-safe and modern development.

## How to use

Once you've cloned a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
